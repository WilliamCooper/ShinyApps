<p>Several additional lessons can be learned from this calibration
exercise: 
</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-3004x1"></a><span style="text-decoration: none"><i>An
	error in the final calibration arises from the precision of the
	sensor.</i></span> The calibration points were generated from a
	known polynomial with the addition of assumed small errors, such
	that the results used for the calibration differ from that known
	polynomial. The standard deviation of those differences was 0.12, so
	these errors should introduce an error smaller than this when the
	calibration is used. Furthermore, although this error arises from
	random errors in the calibration, they become systematic errors when
	that calibration is used and cannot be reduced by repeated
	measurements. This is an important motivation for getting the
	calibration to have minimal error. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-3006x2"></a><span style="text-decoration: none"><i>Did
	you interpolate between calibration points to estimate the value of
	</i></span><span style="text-decoration: none"><i><b>x </b></i></span><span style="text-decoration: none"><i>corresponding
	to </i></span><span style="text-decoration: none"><i><b>M = 55</b></i></span><span style="text-decoration: none"><i>,
	to get 11.62? </i></span>That’s a good approach when the random
	error in the calibration measurement is small. However, in a case
	such as this where there is an underlying smooth function that is
	distorted by random error in the calibration points, fitting to a
	smooth curve gives a much better answer than would be obtained by
	simple linear interpolation between the calibration points. To see
	how large this advantage is, random measurands were selected in the
	range of this calibration and the error evaluated for each
	measurement as if using the above quadratic-polynomial calibration
	or using interpolation among the measurements. The standard
	deviation in the first case was 0.1016 and that in the second (using
	interpolation) was 0.2404, showing that the result from fitting to a
	quadratic polynomial gives much better results. The fit smooths the
	errors that arise from the precision of the sensor. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-3008x3"></a><span style="text-decoration: none"><i>For
	this reason, it is very useful to make repeated independent
	measurements at each calibration point.</i></span> If 100 such
	measurements are averaged for each value of the measurand used in
	the calibration, the random error in the value of the measurement at
	each point is reduced by approximately a factor of 10. In this case,
	that reduces the standard deviation between the calibration curve
	and the assumed-correct values to 0.1166. That’s a surprisingly
	minor improvement over the fit determined from the original
	unaveraged data, which gave a corresponding standard deviation of
	0.1205. The fit doesn’t improve because the true calibration is
	higher power than quadratic, although this was obscured by the large
	random error before averaging measurements. More precise calibration
	data now reveals this higher-degree dependence. If a third-degree
	fit is used with the averaged calibration data, the standard
	deviation is reduced to 0.0291, and a fourth-degree polynomial
	reduces the same standard deviation to 0.014, with significance
	tests indicating that all coefficients are needed. The reason is
	that this example was generated using the following equation: <i><b>M
	= a</b></i><sub><i><b>1</b></i></sub> <i><b>+ a</b></i><sub><i><b>2</b></i></sub><i><b>x
	+ a</b></i><sub><i><b>3</b></i></sub><i><b>x</b></i><sup><i><b>2</b></i></sup>
	but, when fitted as a function <i><b>x(M) </b></i>fourth-degree
	terms are needed to represent this dependence. The result is that
	averaging 100 measurements per calibration value and using a
	high-degree fit leads to negligible residual error and so to
	negligible systematic error when the calibration is used. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p><a name="x1-3010x4"></a><span style="text-decoration: none"><i>When
	using higher-degree fits like this, there is considerable danger if
	the resulting calibration is extrapolated beyond the range covered
	by the original calibration.</i></span> The figure below shows the
	fourth-degree calibration, as the red line, and the underlying
	transfer curve (blue line) from which the small-precision
	measurements, also shown, were generated. The calibration represents
	the measurements very well, but when extrapolated beyond its range
	of validity it can create serious errors. This is always a danger
	when high-degree functions are used to represent calibrations.</p>
