for AT plots</b></font></font></p>

<p>This tab tests ATX by assuming that the avionics temperature AT_A
has been consistent over projects. If that is the case, a prediction
of ATX based on AT_A should test for consistency in a new project. A
fit to an apparently very good project (CSET) has been used to
predict ATX via a quadratic polynomial called ATFIT, which has
residual standard deviation from AT_A of about 0.3 <sup>o</sup>C.
This is similar to our estimated uncertainty in ATX, so this formula
provides a stringent prediction of ATX that should be able to detect
any significant error in new projects. 
</p>
<p>The drop-down menu, flight number, and “All” checkbox in the
top panel allow selection of any flight in the data archives. The
“All” checkbox requires reading all the data files for a given
project, so it will take longer (up to a minute or so before plots
will appear).</p>
<p>The measurements entering these plots have some restrictions
applied to avoid large departures that are usually not indicative of
real problems. The restrictions are: rate of climb between -1 and 1
m/s (because PS_A has delayed response), TASX &gt; 90 (to avoid
possible periods with flaps), and the rate of change in TASX &lt; 0.1
m/s per second (also to avoid problems with the slow response of
PS_A).</p>
<p>There is some variation in selection of the probe used for ATX.
For the reference plots from CSET, ATX was ATH1, but different
choices have been made for various projects so that will introduce
some variation in these plots. In rare cases where AT_A has been
used, the results will be relatively poor. Otherwise, is proper
calibrations are used for other probes, there should be reasonable
consistency with the CSET results. 
</p>
<p>The standard deviation in the first plot will ideally be about
0.3<sup>o</sup>C, but standard deviations of two or three times this
may indicate variable conditions instead of real problems. When
departures exceed about 1<sup>o</sup>C, either in offset or standard
deviation, this is an indication of some problem. The second plot
shows the dependence of the difference on PCXC, with the number on
the right showing the number of measurements included at each level
in the plot. Larger deviations are expected where there are small
numbers of observations. Systematic departures with pressure may
indicate problems that should be investigated. No error bar is
displayed if the limits would extend beyond the range of the plot,
although normally the plot range will be extended to prevent that.</p>
