Height-of-Terrain Tab</h3>
<p><!--l. 135-->The height-of-terrain tab has code for adding two
variables to netCDF files, SFC and ALTG. SFC is the height of the
surface below the aircraft location (m MSL) and ALTG is the altitude
of the aircraft above the surface. SFC + ALTG = GGALT, the altitude
as measured by the GPS receiver on the aircraft.<!--l. 141--> 
</p>
<p>The controls for this tab allow you to select the project and
flight (or all flights, using the &ldquo;ALL&rdquo; checkbox). Before
the processing script can run, it must download the terrain data if
it is not already present, and this may take as much as 10 min per
flight. The program checks the range in latitude and longitude
covered by the flight(s) and downloads all the data needed to cover
those locations. The data source is described below. The result is a
plot of the flight track and one showing the time series of three
variables {SFC, ALTG, GGALT}. The processor also produces a new
netCDF file in the same location as the original file with &rsquo;Z&rsquo;
appended to the name (e.g., CSETrf01Z.nc).<!--l. 151-->

<h3 class="western"><a name="x1-2000"></a>The Source For Data</h3>
<p><a name="x1-2001f1"></a><a name="x1-2002f2"></a><!--l. 153-->During
the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) of 2000,<a href="HeightOfTerrain2.html#fn1x0">1</a>
<a href="HeightOfTerrain3.html#fn2x0">2</a> the altitude of the
Earth&rsquo;s surface was mapped from 56S to 60N latitude with
resolution of 3 arc-sec or about 90 m at the equator. For the US and
territories, the resolution was 1 arc-sec or about 30 m. The data
from this mission are archived at this web site:
<a href="http://www.webgis.com/srtm3.html">http://www.webgis.com/srtm3.html</a>.
The files can be download in individual files that span 1 degree by 1
degree. Some files are missing because they are entirely over ocean,
where the values should be interpreted as zero. The format of these
files leads to the need for some processing that is documented here.<!--l. 164-->
</p>
<p>The R code that downloaded these files is in the &rsquo;chunk&rsquo;
of this document called &rsquo;download-zip-files&rsquo;. Initially,
this was tested for DEEPWAVE, for which the range downloaded covered
40S to 48S and 165E to 175E. After unzipping, the data set was about
115 MB. The heights in the 3-arc-sec files are presented in 1201<i><b>&times;</b></i>1201
arrays where the edges duplicate the values in the adjacent arrays.
The missing-value flag is -32768. The format is row-major, i.e., the
1201 values for the first west-to-east row are presented first, then
the next row to the north, etc. Because R is inherently column-major,
there are some aspects of indexing in the code provided here that
have indices reversed from what might have been expected. The
unpacked files have 2,884,802 bytes.<!--l. 177--> 
</p>
<p><a name="x1-2003f3"></a>The reference location for each 1-degree
by 1-degree array is the name of the individual file (e.g.,
&quot;S43E173.hgt&quot; has a reference position of 43<sup>&#8728;</sup>S
and 173<sup>&#8728;</sup>E at the center of the lower left element of
the array). The values give the height in meters above the
WGS84/EGM96 geoid. The measurement uncertainty was about 9 m at 90%
confidence<a href="HeightOfTerrain4.html#fn3x0">3</a> (Farr et
al.~2007), but there are some biases. The SAR-radar technique did not
penetrate fully through vegetation and so might reflect the top of
the vegetation canopy or some level intermediate between the canopy
and the surface, and the radar penetrated a few meters into snow and
so measured a height between the snow cover and the terrain (as
measured in Feb.&nbsp;2000). Also, there are some gaps, especially in
mountainous areas.</p>
