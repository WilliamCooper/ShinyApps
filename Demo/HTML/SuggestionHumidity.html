<h1>Checking Humidity Measurements: Recommendations</h1>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p>Start with the &quot;Review&quot; tab; see plots 5--8. Use
	&quot;brush&quot; to zoom to problems. Look for general consistency
	with past projects.</p>
	<li/>
<p>Use the &quot;Known Problems&quot; -&gt; &quot;DP
	overshoots/SS&quot; tab to check for overshooting regions (usually)
	following rapid descents and regions where the measurements indicate
	significant (more than a few %) supersaturation. Consider saving
	flags for these regions so they can be identified later, either by
	setting the measurement missing or by including a quality flag for
	the measurement. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p>It may be useful to check the &quot;Known Problems&quot; -&gt;
	&quot;in-cloud check&quot; tab again to consider the agreement
	between temperature and dewpoint for measurements in cloud.</p>
	<li/>
<p>The &quot;Known Problems&quot; -&gt;  &quot;check DP cavity
	P&quot; tab should be used to see if the cavity pressures are
	similar to those expected. Significant departures from the
	predictions based on past projects are reasons to suspect the dew
	point measurements.</p>
	<li/>
<p>As with all measurements, it may be useful to check the
	&quot;Known Problems&quot; -&gt; &quot;out of range, frozen, spikes'
	tab also.</p>
</ol>
