<h1>Checking WSC/WDC (horizontal wind): Recommendations</h1>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p>Start with the &quot;Review&quot; tab plots 13--16. Plot 15
	should show a reasonable Schuler oscillation in the difference,
	remaining approximately within the dotted red lines. Plot 16 should
	show only a minor Schuler oscillation for DVEWG/DVNSG (green lines),
	the difference between the result of the complementary-filter and
	the original GPS measurement. Use &quot;brush&quot; to zoom to
	problems. Look for general consistency with past projects. Also
	check both panels in plot 17, where (outside of turns) AKRD should
	be in approximate agreement with AOAREF and SSRD should be in
	reasonable agreement with SSREF.</p>
	<li/>
<p>Use the &quot;Past Projects&quot; -&gt; &quot;Maneuvers&quot;
	tab to check any speed-run, pitch, circle, reverse-heading, or yaw
	maneuvers that are present.</p>
	<li/>
<p>As for all variables, use the &quot;Known Problems&quot; -&gt;
	&quot;out-of-range, frozen, spike&quot; tab to check for problems
	with the basic (i.e., raw, not derived) measurements entering the
	wind calculation. These include the measurements from the INS and
	the pressure differences from the radome or pitot tube.</p>
