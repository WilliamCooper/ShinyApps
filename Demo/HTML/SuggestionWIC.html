<h1>Checking the Vertical Wind: Recommendations</h1>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p>Start with the &quot;Review&quot; tab, plot 13, which shows
	(at the bottom) the vertical wind. Use &quot;brush&quot; to zoom to
	problems. Look for general consistency with past projects and a
	reasonable mean wind. Plot 17 shows the comparison between the
	measured AKRD and the prediction for zero wind (AOAREF); these
	should be in reasonable agreement except in cases with significant
	vertical wind.</p>
	<li/>
<p>Use the &quot;Past Projects&quot; -&gt; &quot;Maneuvers&quot;
	--&gt; &quot;Speed Run&quot; and ... -&gt; &quot;Pitch&quot; tabs if
	there are any corresponding maneuvers available. There is guidance
	under these tabs regarding evaluating these maneuvers, which can
	also be compared to maneuvers from earlier projects. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p>Also under &quot;Past Projects&quot; -&gt; &quot;PSXC&quot;,
	see the &quot;hydrostatic-eq check&quot; tab; measurements should be
	consistent to within a few hPa.</p>
