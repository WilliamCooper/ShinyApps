<h3 class="western"><a name="x1-1000"></a>Instructions for the
&ldquo;Options for Vertical Wind&rdquo; Tab</h3>
<p>This tab has options for the addition of two variables to netCDF
files, WIF (resulting from high-pass filtering of the vertical wind
to eliminate undesirable offsets) and WIY (produced by the
complementary-filter representation of angle of attack). The new
variable for angle of attack, AKY, is also added to the files. 
</p>
<p>To use this tab, select the checkboxes indicating which variables
are to be added to the data files and select the &ldquo;Run WI
Options&rdquo; button. You can also use the &ldquo;Next&rdquo; button
to process the next unprocessed flight, or the &ldquo;All&rdquo;
button to process all flights for a selected project. The resulting
files are named with a &ldquo;X&rdquo; suffix following this pattern:
&ldquo;CSETrf01X.nc&rdquo;. Selecting an already processed flight
will reprocess that flight; selecting &ldquo;All&rdquo; will process
only flights that have not yet been processed.</p>
<p>The WIF calculation will work for all projects, but for projects
preceding DEEPWAVE the WIY solution will produce unsatisfactory
results so that should not be used unless new calibration
coefficients for AKY are determined. The calibration coefficients for
AKY were determined from a combination of data from DEEPWAVE, CSET,
and ORCAS. This is documented in the Kalman Filter technical note and
in a more extensive memo referenced in that technical note.<!--l. 135--></p>
