<p>The pressures in the sensing cavities of the dewpoint sensors are
measured and recorded in variables CAVP_DPL and CAVP_DPR.  Fits to
these measurements for four projects (ARISTO2017, ORCAS, CSET, and
DEEPWAVE), excluding a few cases that appeared to be outliers and
also excluding measurements where the airspeed was less than 90 m/s,
were used to develop predictions for those pressures, plotted here as
PCAV_DPL and PCAV_DPR. The fit equations are shown below the plots.</p>
<p>The plots to the right show these comparisons. Expected tolerances
for the differences between predicted and measured cavity pressures
are about 10 hPa. Differences larger than this can be indicators of a
problem with the pressure measurements, possible obstruction of the
pressure ports, or misorientation of the probes. The correction for
cavity pressure is significant, so errors are reasons to suspect the
resulting measurements of dewpoint.</p>
<p>If the cavity pressure is not measured on a specified project and
flight, plots will not be shown.</p>
