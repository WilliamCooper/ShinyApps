<h1>Instructions for the DP overshoot/SS tab</h1>
<h3 class="western"><a name="x1-1000"></a>Background</h3>
<p class="noindent"><!--l. 125-->The chilled-mirror instruments
depend on maintaining the mirror temperature in equilibrium with the
dewpoint, so delays in heating or cooling the mirror can cause the
measurement to lag behind the right value and then to overshoot when
reaching the right value. This is common during descents when the
dewpoint increases rapidly, but it also occurs at other times as
well. The purpose of the “DP overshoot/SS” tab is to identify
such regions and possibly tag them for further action, which may
include setting the measurement to be missing (i.e., the missing
value flag -32767) or adding a data-quality flag to the output
indicating that the measurement is suspect. The QAtools Shiny app
does not add such flags to the archive, but it records time periods
that might need such flags. Four types of time-interval candidates
are identified: (i) overshoot; (ii) supersaturation; (iii)
out-of-balance; and (iv) miscellaneous analist-identified intervals.
Sets of such intervals can be saved as R data.frames, easily
converted to EXCEL spreadsheets, that have names like
DQFCsetrf03.Rdata and are saved in a subdirectory named “Problems”,
In separate processing, these can be used to modify the archived data
files, perhaps by adding a data-quality variable or by setting time
periods for specific variables to be missing.<!--l. 146--> 
</p>
<p class="noindent">The first release of QAtools only provides these
tests for DPL. A future change will add similar capability for DPR,
but at least for the GV it has been more common for DPR to be
unusable so this extension has been postponed.<!--l. 151--> 
</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="x1-2000"></a>Instructions</h3>
<p class="noindent"><!--l. 153-->Once a project and flight are
selected, a plot will be generated that has these variables: 
</p>
<dl>
	<dt><b>MIRRTMP_DPL</b> 
	</dt><dd>
	The left-chilled-mirror temperature. (This tab focusses on DPL
	because, at least for the GV, DPR is so often questionable that it
	is seldom useful to consider it. Eventually this tab will include a
	DPL/DPR selection menu.) 
	</dd><dt>
	<b>DPERR</b> 
	</dt><dd>
	This variable is an estimate of the error in MIRRTMP_DPL based on
	its second derivative, as described below, and is a useful predictor
	of overshoot events. 
	</dd><dt>
	<b>ATX</b> 
	</dt><dd>
	The temperature, provided for reference. (Normally, the mirror
	temperature should not exceed the temperature.) 
	</dd><dt>
	<b>CBAL</b> 
	</dt><dd>
	A running-mean value of the BALANCE variable provided by the
	instrument, indicating times when the mirror temperature is not in
	balance with the equilibrium vapor pressure. 
	</dd><dt>
	<b>DPLQUAL</b> 
	</dt><dd>
	This variable is calculated to be an automatically generated
	indicator of periods when the data quality of the measurement is
	questionable and should be flagged. 
	</dd><dt>
	<b>MT_DPL</b> 
	</dt><dd style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">
	This variable is only shown if the “add VCSEL prediction” button
	is selected. It is a prediction of what the mirror temperature
	should be, and it is calculated including compensation for the
	pressure in the chilled-mirror sensing cavity. The calculation of
	this variable takes about a minute, and after clicking the button
	you should wait for the in-progress message at the bottom right of
	the window to disappear before proceeding. When the VCSEL performs
	well, departures between this variable and the measured mirror
	temperature are good indicators of mirror-temperature problems.</dd></dl>
<p class="noindent">
<!--l. 181-->If no processing has yet been saved for a particular
flight, the displayed plot will show these variables for the full
flight. If previous processing has been saved, a set of candidates
will be listed in the bottom-left panel, and these can be edited. The
initial processing steps differ for these two cases: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><u>Case 1: No previously saved
	data-quality file.</u> In this case, the list in the bottom-left
	panel will include onlyu “none”. The first step then is to
	generate a list of candidate time intervals where there may be
	problems. This list will appear when you click the “search”
	button. These events are candidates for overshooting or unrealistic
	supersaturation. Additional events will be generated if you click
	the “auto Flag” button; these are regions flagged on the basis
	of indications from the instrument that it is not in balance with
	the existing water-vapor pressure in the instrument cavity. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p><u>Case 2: A previously saved data-quality file exists for
	this flight.</u>&nbsp; In that case, a list of candidates will
	appear in the bottom-left pane. Only candidates previously
	identified as appropriate to include in the data-quality file and
	listed with “Y” just right of the indicator button in the list
	will be saved, however. If you want to see additional candidates and
	perform the full review again, you can select the “search”
	button. New candidates added by the search button by default have
	“N” as the to-be-saved indicator, so you can distinguish newly
	added events from previously saved events. Usually it is not
	necessary to repeat the “auto flag” process unless previous
	processing has rejected an interval, and by default suto-flagged
	intervals have “Y” as the to-be-saved indicator so they will
	usually already be in the data-quality file.</p>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><!--l. 210-->In either Case 1 or Case 2, you can
then proceed to review the candidate events. You can create a list
with “Y” indicating events to save in the data-quality file and
“N” indicating events to discard. You can proceed using these
actions: 
</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-2002x1"></a>To
	change all indicators to “Y”, click the “accept all” button.
		</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-2004x2"></a>To
	review a specific event, by click on its radio button. The display
	will change to a time interval spanning the event but focused on it.
	A title line will indicate the type of potentially erroneous event
	(i.e, “overshoot”, “supersaturation”, “balance” or
	“other”). Modify the event using one or more of the following: 
	</p>
</ol>
<ul>
	<ul>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-2006x1"></a>There
		are two time slider controls, one controlling the full period
		displayed and a second controlling the subset interval to be
		flagged as questionable. Usually you will not need to change the
		first, but the second may need fine adjustment. The easiest way to
		set this interval is to “brush” over the desired time interval
		(i.e., hold down the left mouse button while sliding the cursor
		over the desired interval). You can reset this interval to the full
		displayed interval using the “reset this slider” button, with
		the “brush affects which slider?” menu set to “data-quality
		flag...”, or you can move the delimiters on the second time
		slider (perhaps using the left/right arrows after clicking on the
		slider delimiters for fine adjustment). When you adjust the
		data-quality-flag time interval, the “Y/N” indicator is
		automatically set to “Y”. 
		</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-2008x2"></a>Use the
		“reject” button to reset the indicator to “N”. The display
		will automatically move to the next candidate if any remain in the
		list. 
		</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-2010x3"></a>Use the
		“accept” button to accept the event as displayed and move to
		the next event (if any remain). 
		</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-2012x4"></a>Use the
		“next” button to move to the next event without making any
		changes to the existing event. This has the same effect as clicking
		on the next radio button.</p>
	</ul>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-2014x3"></a>To add a
	user-generated event to the data.frame, use the “define new”
	button. You need to use both time sliders in this case, the top one
	to define an appropriate display interval for the event and the
	bottom or data-quality one to define the limits of the interval
	containing data to be flagged. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p><a name="x1-2016x4"></a><a name="textcolor6"></a>When the
	displayed “Y/N” indicators are set appropriately, click the
	“save” button. Unless you do, nothing will be saved and you will
	need to start over when you return to this flight. Changing the
	project or flight number also replaces the working list with an
	appropriate one for the new flight. You can save repeatedly because
	each save overwrites what was saved previously, so it’s useful to
	save frequently while working through the candidate list.</p>
