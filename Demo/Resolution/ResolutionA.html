<h3 class="western"><a name="x1-1000"></a>Exercise Objective</h3>
<p class="noindent"><!--l. 127-->The term “resolution” has many
definitions, some conflicting. This exercise seeks to clarify why
characterizing the resolution is difficult, and it will explain some
of the varying usages of this term. An interactive display is used to
clarify some of the concepts and avoid numerical evaluation of
probabilities on the part of the reader. A backup document with plots
but without the interactive exercise is included at <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1kIUH45ca5AS1lVY05rNUtRbFU">this
URL</a>.<!--l. 135-->

<h3 class="western"><a name="x1-2000"></a>Definitions of “resolution”</h3>
<p class="noindent"><!--l. 137-->There are several component
contributions to the resolution, and in practice the term is often
applied to these individual components as well as to their net
result. The components include: 
</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p class="noindent"><a name="magicparlabel-442317"></a>The
	smallest difference between measurements that indicates that the
	corresponding measurands are different. The indication will have an
	associated confidence level, often 68.3% or that corresponding to
	one standard deviation.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="noindent">A primary factor influencing this aspect
	of resolution is the precision of the instrument. This is discussed
	extensively below. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p class="noindent"><a name="x1-2004x2"></a>The smallest
	change in the indicator (e.g., meter or digital display) that can be
	perceived. For example, the instrument resolution may be limited by
	the ability of an operator to read an analog display or hysteresis
	in that display, or by the smallest incremental change reported by a
	digital display. In the case of a digitized result, the resolution
	is limited by the change corresponding to one unit in the digitized
	output. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p class="noindent"><a name="x1-2006x3"></a>For a
	spectrometer, the smallest difference in frequency that can be
	resolved. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p class="noindent"><a name="x1-2008x4"></a>For a time series,
	the temporal resolution is the increment between consecutive
	measurements, although if a particular sensor responds more slowly
	than this the temporal resolution of that sensor may be lower.</p>
</ol>
