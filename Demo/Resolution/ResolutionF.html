<h4 class="western"><a name="x1-5000"></a>Summary</h4>
<p class="noindent"><!--l. 402-->The author’s preferred definition
of resolution is, “the smallest difference between measurements
that indicates that the corresponding measurands are different.”
With this definition, if a level of confidence corresponding to one
standard deviation (about 68.3%) is desired, the resolution of an
instrument or sensor is about twice the precision with which the
instrument makes measurements. Use the “show PDFs” tab with the
first slider set to 2 and the second to 1 to see this case. If the
measurement is encoded by an analog-to-digital converter, the
resolution is further limited by the difference in measurand
corresponding to a one-bit change in the digitized output, as
illustrated <a href="#x1-40017">i</a>n the “meaning #2” tab. 
This is often described as the resolution of the measurement, but
this usage is incorrect unless the resolution of the digitizer is the
dominant limitation on the resolution.<!--l. 420--> 
</p>
<p class="noindent">A different and often used definition is that the
resolution is the separation D between two measurements at which the
two mutually exclusive hypotheses are acceptable with equal
confidence: (i) that the measurands are the same; and (ii) that the
measurands differ by at least D. With this definition, the resolution
is the precision of the instrument.
