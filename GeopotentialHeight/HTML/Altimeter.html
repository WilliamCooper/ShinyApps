<h1>The Altimeter Setting</h1>
<p>The altimeter setting is an alternate way of interpolating from an
elevated-station pressure to a surface pressure, so this discussion
is complementary to the discussion of sea-level pressure in the main
module. At levels below 18,000 ft (about 5486 m), aircraft use an
altimeter setting reported from a nearby surface station in order to
determine their altitudes. The setting is a compensation to the
standard-atmosphere reading of the altimeter to ensure that, when an
aircraft lands using that setting, the surface will appear at the
expected elevation. Using a common altimeter setting also ensures
flight levels assigned to aircraft are consistent. Without such
compensation, the altimeter could indicate serious errors when the
atmosphere differs from standard-atmosphere stratification.<!--l. 305-->
</p>
<p><!--l. 361--><!--l. 363-->The diagram in the right panel
illustrates the relationships among the station pressure (ps),
station altitude (zs), and altimeter setting. The default case
considered has a station elevation of 1350 m and station pressure of
885 hPa. The left axis shows the standard-atmosphere relationship
between altitude and pressure for a portion of the atmosphere below 2
km. Also shown are the assumed station elevation (red dot labeled
“zs”) and station pressure (blue dot labeled “ps”). If these
were at corresponding positions on the axis, the altimeter setting
would be that for the standard atmosphere (29.92 inHg). Because they
are not matched, the way to get agreement between the station
pressure and station elevation is to move the pressure scale upward
along the height scale until the station pressure matches the station
elevation. Once those match, the pressure on the right scale at sea
level (here 1040.3 hPa) is the altimeter setting. (Altimeter settings
always have units of inches of mercury, so this needs to be converted
to 1040.3*29.92/1013.25≈30.72 inHg. As discussed in the section on
units, this unit would be best avoided if possible. It is unfortunate
that it is thoroughly embedded in aviation instruments.) Altimeters
used on aircraft adjust their displayed altitude-vs-pressure in just
this way, adding or subtracting a fixed altitude at all pressures.</p>
<p>You can use the interactive display in the right panel to find the
altimeter setting for other conditions. Enter the station pressure
and elevation into the top two entry slots, and then adjust the
altimeter-setting slider until the adjusted station pressure
displayed with the right-axis values matches the station elevation.
The slider then displays the altimeter setting in units of inHg,
while the blue number at the bottom of the right axis shows the
equivalent value in hPa.</p>
<p>If you prefer an analytical expression for the altimeter setting,
you can use the following equation, which is readily derived from the
hydrostatic equation and the definition of the standard atmosphere.

(Note: The official calculation of altimeter setting specifies that 0.3 hPa
should be subtracted from the station pressure when performing this
calculation. This accounts for the 
difference between heights at which station pressure is measured and
where aircraft typically measure pressure when on the ground. 
However, no corresponding adjustment is made to station elevation.)
