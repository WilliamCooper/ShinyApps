Explorer</h1>
<p class="noindent"><!--l. 392--><font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif">The
preceding tabs mostly treated the air as dry and neglected the
effects of humidity. Water vapor in varying amounts is present in
real cases, so it is useful to consider the magnitude of its
influence. In the Temperature Module, the concept of virtual
temperature was used to compensate for the change in mean molecular
weight caused by water vapor. With this substitution, the equations
presented for the integration of the hydrostatic equation remain
valid if <i><b>T</b></i> <sub><i><b>v</b></i></sub><i><b>(z) </b></i>is
used instead of <i><b>T (z) </b></i>while continuing to use the
dry-air molecular weight and gas constant. </font>
</p>
<p class="noindent"><!--l. 412--><font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif">This
tab supports exploration of some soundings to illustrate the
magnitude of the differences caused by humidity and departures from
the standard atmosphere. You can select various stations from the
drop-down list, and you can specify different dates. The top panels
show the height and temperature profiles vs. pressure, and the bottom
panel shows the differences among some possible altitude
calculations. The reference for the bottom plot, the geometric
altitude, is calculated for moist air and includes the latitude and
height dependences of gravity. The blue line shows geopotential
altitude calculated for moist air, and the green line is the
corresponding result when the air is assumed to be dry. The cyan line
in the bottom panel shows the pressure altitude as in the ISA
(International Standard Atmosphere). The variable plotted as the red
line in the bottom panel is the &quot;d-value&quot;, defined as the
difference between geopotential height and pressure altitude. It is
sometimes used to construct maps of pressure fields.</font></p>

web site maintained by the Department of Atmospheric Science,

and saved in the Shiny app; others are retrieved as they are

<p class="noindent"><font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif">Here are
some features in the soundings to note while you explore the
available options:</font></p>

	displacement upward of the heights shown in the top-left panel. The

	higher </font><font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif">moisture
	content at low levels produces a virtual temperature (green line)
	significantly higher than the temperature, and as a result the
	calculated geopotential heights are too low by about 60--80 m,
	indicated by the difference between the blue and green lines in the
	bottom panel. Neglecting the humidity when calculating the
	geopotential height thus can introduce a significant error. </font><font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif">The
