The GeopotentialHeight Shiny app presents material related to geopotential height in the atmosphere and its relationship to geometric height. Also included is a calculator that references archived soundings from the University of Wyoming weather-information site and constructs height-vs-pressure soundings from those, with consideration of the effects of humidity and latitude. A separate tab discusses how the altimeter setting is determined.
