Sensors</h3>
<p><!--l. 122-->To measure the vector wind, multi-port sensors are
often used. One example is the five-port sensor shown in the figure
to the right. It is often used on aircraft, but it has other uses as
well. This Shiny app is a demonstration of how it operates, shown in
the next tab. First, this tab presents some information regarding its
performance and helps a reader understand the next tab.<!--l. 129--> 
</p>
<p>The five ports are distributed so that one is approximately in the
forward direction, two are above and below this center line so they
develop a pressure difference between them determined by the angle of
attack, and two are similarly oriented on each side to be sensitive
to the lateral flow at an angle called the sideslip angle. In
addition, there are a ring of ports surrounding the cylinder that
provide a source of air at approximately ambient pressure.<!--l. 137-->
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The relationship between the angles of
attack and sideslip and the corresponding pressure difference between
the ports are usually determined by empirical calibrations because,
particularly when installed on aircraft, they are subject to flow
distortion around the aircraft and sensitivity to Mach number so
theoretical relationships are usually insufficient. However,
potential-flow theory provides some guidance because the pressure
distribution around the surface of a sphere is given as follows: 
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="GustPod0x.png" name="Image1" alt="           1-  2     9-  2p θ = p∞ + 2ρV  (1 - 4 sin θ )" align="bottom" width="202" height="35" border="0"/>

</p>
<p><!--l. 148-->where <i><b>p</b></i><sub><i><b>θ</b></i></sub> is
the pressure at an angle <i><b>θ </b></i>from the forward direction,
<i><b>p</b></i><sub>∞</sub> is the ambient pressure far from the
sphere, <i><b>ρ </b></i>is the air density and <i><b>V </b></i>is
the airspeed. To find the flow angle <i><b>θ </b></i>from the
measured pressure difference between two ports on the sphere, one
must also know the dynamic pressure <i><b>q = 0.5ρV</b></i><sup><i><b>2</b></i></sup>.
When the sensor is oriented directly into the wind, this is the
difference in pressure between the forward port and the ports on the
side of the cylinder, but when the flow is directed at an angle to
the sensor this pressure difference also is decreased by the above
formula. In the vertical plane, two measurements, <i><b>Δp </b></i>and
<i><b>Δp</b></i><sub><i><b>a</b></i></sub> constrain the two
variables 0.5<i><b>ρV</b></i><sup><i><b>2</b></i></sup> and <i><b>θ
</b></i>and allow a solution in the form <i><b>θ = f(Δp, Δp</b></i><sub><i><b>a</b></i></sub><i><b>)</b></i>.
This solution is illustrated in the next tab, but practical
applications usually use equations determined empirically because of
the weaknesses mentioned above regarding the potential-flow
solution.<!--l. 165-->
