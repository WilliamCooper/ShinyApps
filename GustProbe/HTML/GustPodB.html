<p class="noindent"><!--l. 167-->The plot to the right shows the flow
angle represented by a specified angle of attack and the pressure,
temperature, and airspeed where the measurement is made. You can
adjust either the angle-of-attack slider or the pressure-difference
slider (representing the pressure difference between the upward- and
downward-oriented ports), and you can study how the ambient pressure
and temperature and the airspeed affect these results. In addition,
the pressure difference between the forward port and the ports on the
side of the cylinder is shown at the bottom of the left panel.<!--l. 177-->

	 is determined. However, the pressure difference displayed at the
	bottom of the left panel still changes with angle of attack because,
	when the forward port is not directly forward, the pressure
	difference is reduced as specified by the equation in the preceding
	tab. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-2004x2"></a>By
	convention, angle of attack is positive for air moving upward
	relative to the sensor. Angle of attack and the pressure difference
	between the top and bottom ports are therefore negatively
	correlated. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p><a name="x1-2006x3"></a>The pressure differences increase
	as the square of the airspeed, making the angle measurements more
	sensitive to pressure as the airspeed increases. However, reducing
	ambient pressure reduces the same sensitivity and so leads to larger
	uncertainties at upper flight levels for a given uncertainty in the
	measurement of the differential pressure.</p>
