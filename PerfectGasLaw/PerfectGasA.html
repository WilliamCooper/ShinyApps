<p><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">The ideal-gas law is the

aspects, including the analysis of the correction to airborne
thermometers for dynamic heating, the use of measurements to deduce
buoyancy, the structure of the atmosphere that determines the

</span><span style="text-decoration: none">exercise indicates some

the atmosphere are used to determine derived thermodynamic properties

<p><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif"><span style="text-decoration: none">This</span>
exercise has the following objectives:</font></p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">To provide
	familiarity with the nature of interactions among the pressure,
	temperature, and density of the air. The ideal-gas law is often
	stated in the form pV=nRT where p is the pressure, V the volume of a
	parcel, n the number of moles of air in the parcel, R the universal
	gas constant, and T the temperature. This is more commonly stated in
	atmospheric science in the equivalent form p=ρR<sub>a</sub>T where
	ρ is the air density (mass per volume) and R<sub>a</sub> is the gas
	constant for air, defined as R/M<sub>a</sub> where M<sub>a</sub> is
	the molecular weight of &quot;air&quot;. When necessary, this must
	be a weighted average of the components of the air, especially
	including the variable contribution from water vapor. The ideal-gas
	law constrains the three variables (p, T, ρ) so that, when two are
	specified, the third is also known.</font></p>
	<li/>
<p><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">To introduce the
	variation in temperature associated with change in pressure of an
	otherwise isolated air parcel.</font></p>
	<li/>
<p><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">To show how this can
	result in buoyancy of a parcel and how that is related to
	instability.</font></p>
	<li/>
<p><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">To consider the
	normal vertical structure of the temperature of the atmosphere and
	how this relates to the preceding considerations.</font></p>
</ol>
<p><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">The next tab provides an
illustration of the constraint imposed by the ideal-gas law. It can
be used to learn the answers to these questions:</font></p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">How does the density
	of an isolated parcel of air change as its temperature changes?
	[linearly, inversely, unchanged] with temperature</font></p>
	<li/>
<p><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">How does the density
	of an isolated parcel of air change as its pressure changes?
	[linearly, inversely, unchanged] with pressure</font></p>
	<li/>
<p><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">Is the density of
	humid air higher, lower, or the same as the density of dry air at
	the same pressure and temperature? [hint: The molecular weight of
	water is about 0.622 times the molecular weight of dry air.]</font></p>
</ol>
<p><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">Following that tab are
additional tabs where the ideal-gas law is used to understand other
properties of the atmosphere.</font></p>
<div id="sdfootnote1">
	<p class="sdfootnote"><a class="sdfootnotesym" name="sdfootnote1sym" href="#sdfootnote1anc">1</a>Why
	the hyphen? Because it is a law for an ideal gas, not an ideal law
	for a gas. However, &quot;ideal gas law&quot; is often used
	elsewhere without the hyphen.</p>
