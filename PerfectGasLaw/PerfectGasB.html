<h1><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">Adiabatic Processes</font></h1>
<p><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">A process that occurs
without the transfer of heat or mass across the boundaries of the
system is called adiabatic. If a confined gas in a cylinder is
compressed by the motion of a piston while the cylinder resides in a
reservoir that maintains its temperature, that process is not
adiabatic because heat will be transferred from the cylinder to the
reservoir. However, equalization of pressure that occurs when a valve
separating two chambers is opened is adiabatic. When a buoyant parcel
(i.e., one having density lower than its surroundings) rises in the
atmosphere, the process in the core of the parcel can be approximated
as adiabatic, so relationships for adiabatic processes are useful
when one considers stability in the atmosphere. An adiabatic process
can still include work done on or by the system, where the work is
equal to the pressure times the change in volume.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">To consider relationships
for an adiabatic process, we need both the first law of
thermodynamics (essentially, energy conservation) and the ideal-gas
law. The first law states:

where U is the internal energy (C<sub>v</sub>T for an ideal gas), Q
is the heat transferred (zero for an adiabatic process), and p and v
refer to the pressure and specific volume (volume per mass, or the
inverse of the density). </font>
