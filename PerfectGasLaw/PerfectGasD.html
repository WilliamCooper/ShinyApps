<h1><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">Buoyancy</font></h1>
<p><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">The principle discovered by
Archemides is that a body immersed in fluid will experience an upward
force from the surrounding fluid equal to the weight of the fluid it
displaces. As applied to a parcel of air, this indicates that a
parcel will experience an upward force equal to the difference
between the weight of the fluid it displaces and the weight of the
parcel, the latter provided by gravity. If the parcel is less dense
than the surrounding fluid, it will experience an upward force and
will rise. The density of a parcel is related to pressure,
temperature, and moisture content through the ideal-gas law, where
the dependence on moisture enters through the effect of water vapor
on the gas constant. This can be simplified through use of the
virtual temperature, defined elsewhere in this module.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">As an air parcel is heated
by contact with the warm surface, some preferred locations develop
temperature above their surroundings at the same pressure and so have
lower density. The parcel will rise and, as it reaches levels with
lower pressure, will cool from adiabatic expansion as discussed in
the preceding tab. If its new density is still lower than the
surrounding atmosphere, it will remain buoyant and continue to
accelerate until it reaches a level where the density of the
environment matches the density of the parcel. Surface heating
therefore tends to lead to development of a surface boundary layer
where the stratification is determined by adiabatic expansion.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">Let's first neglect the
effect of water vapor and see how the material in the preceding tabs
can be used to predict the rate of change of temperature with
altitude, dT/dz. The hydrostatic equation that relates the change in
pressure with altitude can be written</font></p>

<font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">and, using the differential
form of the Poisson relationship from the previous tab gives 
<img src="PerfectGasD_html_6ffcd69cfd89476d.png" name="Object2" align="bottom" hspace="8" width="120" height="40" border="0"/>

˚C/m or about -10˚C/km. This is the expected lapse rate in the
boundary layer just above a heated surface, and it is obtained by
combining the ideal-gas law, the Poisson relationship for adiabatic
expansion, and the hydrostatic equation relating change in pressure
to change in altitude.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">If the atmosphere decreases
in temperature more slowly than this, the rising parcel will become
negatively buoyant and stop rising. Conversely, if the atmosphere
decreases in temperature faster than this, the stratification is
unstable and it will rapidly overturn to produce the expected lapse
rate for adiabatic ascent. It is common to find a surface layer with
this lapse rate capped on top by a rising-temperature level or
&quot;inversion&quot; that prevents continued ascent of parcels from
the surface until it is eroded by continued surface heating and
associated increase in the temperature of the surface layer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">It is useful to have a
measure of the varying temperature in such a surface layer, and that
is provided by the &quot;potential temperature,&quot; the temperature
that any parcel in the uniformly mixed boundary layer would have if
carried adiabatically to the 1000-hPa level. The equation for the
potential temperature is 
<img src="PerfectGasD_html_ce71329ac508ba1.png" name="Object3" align="bottom" hspace="8" width="144" height="40" border="0"/>

. The Poisson relationship from the previous tab shows that the
potential temperature remains constant during adiabatic ascent or
descent of dry air. This then leads to several alternative
representations of buoyancy (defined as the upward acceleration
experience by a parcel):</font></p>

</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">The
generalization to moist air is straightforward because the virtual
temperature represents the temperature of dry air that would have the
same density as the moist parcel, so it is only necessary to replace
temperature with virtual temperature or potential temperature with
virtual potential temperature.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">Here are some
questions to test your understanding of buoyancy:</font></p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p align="left"><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">The
	standard atmosphere uses a reference altitude that is zero at
	1013.25 hPa and 15˚C. What is the corresponding potential
	temperature at the zero reference level?</font></p>
	<li/>
<p align="left"><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">At a
	given pressure, density is affected by changes in temperature or in
	water vapor content. Consider rain falling through a well-mixed
	surface layer with constant potential temperature. The evaporation
	of rain cools a parcel, but it also increases the humidity, and
	these have opposite effects on the density. Which is more important?
	(I.e., is the density of the parcel higher or lower than before
	evaporation of rain into it?) [The right information to answer this
	hasn't been presented, but you have seen the general effect of
	moisture on density from tab 2 and you have experience with
	evaporative cooling, so the answer should be evident without backup
	calculations.]</font></p>
	<li/>
<p align="left"><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">Right,
	it becomes higher in density and hence negatively buoyant and begins
	to sink. How far does it go in a well-mixed layer before stopping?
	[Although slowed by mixing, it will remain negatively buoyant all
	the way to the surface. This is an important mechanism leading to
	downbursts.]</font></p>
	<li/>
<p align="left"><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">Fast-responding
	thermometers on aircraft are needed to measure the buoyancy of a
	parcel. (a) Estimate what response is needed to detect buoyancy
	below a cloud 1 km in diameter from an aircraft flying at 200 m/s.
	[small compared to 5 s]. If the precision in measured temperature is
	0.3˚C, what is the (approximate) resolution with which buoyancy can
	be measured? [g*0.3/273=0.01 m/s^2, but the earlier discussion of
	resolution in module #2 indicated that this should be doubled, so a
	better answer is 0.02 m/s<sup>2</sup>. This can still be important:
	Over 100 s, this acceleration causes a change of 2 m/s, so buoyancy
	measurements with sufficiently small uncertainty to be used for this
	purpose are difficult to obtain.] </font>
	</p>
	<li/>
<p align="left"><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">Once
	condensation begins in a rising parcel, does that process usually
	increase or decrease the buoyancy of the parcel? [The processes
	involved are the release of latent heat, decreasing the density, the
	reduction of water vapor pressure, increasing the density, and the
	appearance of liquid water, increasing the density. The first is
	dominant, so the buoyancy increases, but the third can cause water
	mass to accumulate to the point where it has a significant effect
	unless the condensed rain falls out of the parcel.]</font></p>
	<li/>
<p align="left"><font face="Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif">In a
	stable boundary layer (one that resists vertical motion of parcels),
	does the potential temperature increase, decrease, or remain
	constant with increasing altitude?</font></p>
