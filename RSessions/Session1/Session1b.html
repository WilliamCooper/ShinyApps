<h3 class="western"><a name="x1-2000"></a>A quick tour of the RStudio
window panes:</h3>
<p>This section will work best if you can start a separate RStudio
window to be able to view these panes. If you are viewing this from
within RStudio, you may still be able to start another session.</p>
<p>You have seen the ’Files’ window (lower right pane) before;
click on that to see the files in RStudio/RSessions. Then click on
’RSessionsDataFrame.Rnw’ to have something to look at. It will
appear in the top left window. Don’t worry about the details of
what is there just yet; we’ll get back to that. First, notice that
there are four panes visible. At start-up, you will usually see these
panes: 
</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-2002x1"></a>Top
	left: The source editor, where a working file (or many working files
	in tabs) are displayed. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-2004x2"></a>Bottom
	left: The console, where you can enter R commands just as you would
	in the command-line mode that you would use without RStudio. Try it
	now: Click where the ’&gt;’ prompt is displayed, type 2+2
	[enter]. I use this frequently as a very capable calculator, because
	the math functions and R functions are all available here. Try ’pi’,
	’rnorm(5, 3.5, 0.5)’, plot(0:360, sin(0:360 * pi / 180),
	type=’l’), and ’Ranadu::WetEquivalentPotentialTemperature
	(P=800., AT=25., E=Ranadu::MurphyKoop (DP=20., P=800), w=0). 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p><a name="x1-2006x3"></a>Top right: This pane has several
	functions.<!--l. 238--> 
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-2008x1"></a>The
		’History’ tab displays the history of what you have entered in
		the console, along with options to transfer lines either to the
		source editor or to the console for re-execution, possibly with
		editing (although that function is available more conveniently from
		the console using the up and down arrows to move through the
		history). 
		</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-2010x2"></a>Another
		tab will show the environment, where defined variables for your
		workspace are shown. [Try X = 5 in the console and see what appears
		here.] There is also a useful tab for importing a data set from
		either a web location or a text file. 
		</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-2012x3"></a>This
		pane also has a ’git’ tab if you have set up the project as
		recommended above, where you can monitor the status of what has
		changed since you last downloaded from the repository and can
		commit back to your local repository (although I haven’t set up
		my external github repository to allow you to ’Push” back to
		that repository).</p>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"></p>
	</ol>
	<li/>
<p><a name="x1-2014x4"></a>Bottom right: Again, several
	functions.<!--l. 256--> 
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-2016x1"></a>Plot:
		If you tried the examples in item 2 above, you will have noticed
		this pane switch to ’Plots’ and display the latest plot.
		RStudio also maintains a history of the plots that have been
		generated, and you can skip back through that history, which seems
		endless in my experience so far. The ’export’ function in the
		’Plot’ tab allows you to save the plot externally to either png
		or pdf format. 
		</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-2018x2"></a>Files:
		This displays the files in the working directory, which for now
		should be the project directory. There are a few functions for
		dealing with those files. 
		</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-2020x3"></a>Help:
		Requests for help are displayed in this window. If you click on the
		’Home’ button, you are taken to a page that shows links to some
		of the basic manuals and also a definitive definition of the
		language, along with other more specialized manuals. If you want to
		know how a particular function works, you can enter your search
		phrase into the console as, for example, ?atan2 to see information
		on the arctangent function, or you can enter this into the entry
		line on the help window, which has the advantage that it displays
		auto-completion options as you type. [Try ’plot’ to see this in
		action.] There are many cross-references among the help pages that
		are quite useful. If you click on the left drop-down menu you will
		see a history of the help topics you have consulted. 
		</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-2022x4"></a>Viewer:
		I’m going to postpone discussion of this until later; we won’t
		need the viewer for a while. 
		</p>
		<li/>
<p><a name="x1-2024x5"></a>Packages: This displays the
		packages that are available for your use, either in the system-wide
		repository or in mine (if you have established assess to mine via
		one of the methods discussed earlier or in the appendix). To test
		if you have access to my functions, look for ’Ranadu’ in the
		list. If it is there, let your mouse linger over it and its
		location will be displayed. You could try this for other packages
		also; check, for example, ggplot2, a very useful plotting package.
		The check boxes indicate which packages will be available in your
		session without special loading; if unchecked, you can either check
		the box or include a statement similar to ’require(Ranadu)’ in
		your session (or when you use these functions, use the form
		Ranadu::routine_you_want). The ’install’ and ’update’
		functions at the top of the ’Packages’ pane provide easy access
		to the ’CRAN’ archive of packages or to packages you may have
		from other sources that you want to load for use.</p>
