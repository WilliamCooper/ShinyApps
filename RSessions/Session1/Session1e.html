<h3 class="western">Getting the RAF (Ranadu) Package</h3>
<p><!--l. 422-->For use on barolo, a procedure suggested in the first
tab will provide access to my package of routines for use with RAF
netCDF files. You may want to install to your own files on that
computer or on another system. One reason for doing that is that,
when the version of R changes, the reference listed there will no
longer be up-to-date, and compatibility problems may arise. Here are
steps for obtaining that package on other systems or on your own file
system:<!--l. 427--> 
</p>
<p>If not on barolo, you may first need to install some packages on
which Ranadu depends. (These are all present on barolo.) The Ranadu
dependencies are: ncdf, maps, ggplot2, ggthemes , graphics, and grid.
The package also imports from the following packages, although they
aren’t required unless the corresponding routines are used: tcltk
(sparsely used), nleqslv, zoo, fields, stats, signal, and reshape2.
You will also want knitr if you don’t already have it. If any of
those do not appear in your list of packages (displayed by selecting
the ’Packages’ tab in the bottom right pane of RStudio), click
’Install’ at the top of that pane, select ’repository (CRAN)’
in the first drop-down menu, and enter a list of packages that you
are missing in the second line labeled ’Packages’. The default
location for local libraries on the last line should be kept, and the
check-box labeled ’Install dependencies’ should be checked. Click
’Install” and those packages will be downloaded from the CRAN
repository, compiled where necessary, and added to your list of
packages. This may take a while. After doing that, to get the package
’Ranadu’, follow these steps: 
</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-6002x1"></a>Within
	RStudio, select ’File’ -&gt; ’New Project’ -&gt; ’Version
	Control’ -&gt; ’Git’ (clone a repository) 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-6004x2"></a>For the
	package URL, enter ’https://github.com/WilliamCooper/Ranadu.git’
	(without the quote marks). Use the package name ’Ranadu’ and
	make the directory for it a subdirectory under ’RStudio’. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-6006x3"></a>Click
	’Create Project’ and RStudio will download the files and change
	the working project to Ranadu. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Select the “Build” tab (top
	right pane) and then “Build and reload”. The package will be
	installed to your local repository and will be ready to use.
	Alternately, in case the preceding doesn’t work, try this:</p>
	<ol type="a">
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-6008x4"></a>Go to
		the ’Packages’ window and click ’Install’ 
		</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-6010x5"></a>In the
		new window that appears, change the top drop-down menu from CRAN to
		’Package archive file’ 
		</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-6012x6"></a>A
		window will appear that displays all the files in your home
		directory. Go to the directory RStudio, then to directory Ranadu,
		and in that directory select ’Ranadu-1.0-14-10-07-std.tar.gz’
		(or whatever the highest-version-number is there). 
		</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-6014x7"></a>For
		’Install to library ...’ you should be able to use the default
		for your system. It should point to a directory in your local file
		space. On my laptop it is
		’/home/cooperw/R/x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu-library/3.2’. This
		should have been defined during R installation as the directory for
		local packages. 
		</p>
		<li/>
<p><a name="x1-6016x8"></a>Click ’Install’. The package
		’Ranadu’ should appear in your list of packages. If an error
		occurs, be sure you have installed the packages listed in the
		paragraph above this numbered list, and then tell me so I can try
		to help.</p>
	</ol>
</ol>
<p>Here is an alternative that you should use if you plan to write
shiny apps (discussed later) using Ranadu:
devtools::install_github(“WilliamCooper/Ranadu”). You may need to
install the package &quot;devtools&quot; first. The advantage of
using this command is that the package is then available for upload
to a Shiny Server web site when you want to deploy the shiny app.</p>
