<p><!--l. 151-->This is an addition to the “RSessions” tutorial
that provided guidance on getting started with analyzing aircraft
data using R and the “Ranadu” package of routines. This is more
detailed than the other tutorials in those sessions and attempts to
be reasonably thorough in its review of spectral analysis using R,
although it (as of yet) does not include discussion of coherence,
phase, and the cross-spectrum and co-spectrum.<!--l. 159--> 
</p>
<p>The R code for the entire app is displayed, either to the right of
the main display or below it. There is a button to click to toggle 
between these two positions. That code shows in detail how the
plots, and in particular the plots generated interactively in the
right tab, are being generated. 
</p>
<p>The focus here is on spatio-temporal data, data sets where the
variables have associated locations and times. Examples are a time
series constructed from consecutive measurements at a fixed location
and a set of simultaneous (or “synoptic”) measurements made at
various locations. Standard statistical characteristics like the
mean, variance, and standard deviation represent the data sets, but
it is also useful to describe their internal character by considering
two additional characteristics: (i) How are the measurements
correlated in time or space (respectively), and (ii) Can the measured
fields be represented in terms of sums of frequency or wavelength
components? The former leads to the autocovariance and
autocorrelation functions and the latter to decomposition into a
variance spectrum. These two ways of characterizing the data turn out
to be complementary in the sense that knowledge of either one can be
used to generate the other.<!--l. 174--> 
</p>
<p><a name="x1-2f1"></a>These notes focus on the second display,
often called a “power spectrum,” that shows how the variance in a
signal is distributed as a function of frequency or wavelength. 
An example, which will be explained in the course of this note,
is shown below for the hourly pressure measurements made at Denver, CO.
The terms “variance spectrum” (for the plot) and “spectral
variance” (for the plotted variable) are preferred here because the
display is used frequently where the variance does not represent
power as it did in early electrical applications.[footnote 1] The key
concept reflected in the variance spectrum is that such
spatio-temporal series can be decomposed into independent components
that vary in frequency and/or wavelength. The Fourier series is often
used and has valuable associated properties of orthogonality and
completeness so that individual components can be regarded as
independent and the set of such components can represent the observed
series without error. However, the early focus here is on how to
interpret the resulting variance spectrum rather than on how to
construct it. Other sources (e.g., <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1I1q8WTBzMKJGJ8ylRGmmQ8NwcCSgjwST">this
linked URL</a>) can be consulted regarding how to construct such a
representation and some of that material will be repeated here for
completeness, but those more interested in using and interpreting the
variance spectrum can skip the next tab and others marked with an asterisk.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">[footnote 1]: Even for velocity
components, &quot;power spectrum&quot; seems inappropriate. The
specific energy, or energy per unit mass, has units of J/kg or m<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-2</sup>
so the units are the same as the variance in a component of the wind.
In the case of a time series, the spectral variance P(<font face="Liberation Serif, serif">ν</font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">)
</font>can be regarded as the derivative of the cumulative integral
of variance over frequency contributions (<img src="SpecAnalysisA1.gif" name="Object1" hspace="8" width="146" height="38"/>
),
and for a wind component P(<font face="Liberation Serif, serif">ν</font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">)
will have units of  m</font><sup><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">2</font></sup><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">s</font><sup><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">-2

interval or  m</font><sup><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">2</font></sup><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">s</font><sup><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">-1</font></sup><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">.
 </font>The specific power has units of specific energy per time or
m<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-3</sup> (watts per kilogram) <sup> </sup>and the
specific power per frequency interval would have units of m<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-2
 </sup>which differs from the units of P(<font face="Liberation Serif, serif">ν</font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">)
.  </font>In the case of wind, P(<font face="Liberation Serif, serif">ν</font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">)
 </font>is better regarded as a spectral energy rather than a
spectral power.</p>
