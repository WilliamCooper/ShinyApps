<p>Figure&nbsp;3: Variance spectra corresponding to the three cases
presented in the preceding two figures. The dotted-black vertical
lines mark the frequency corresponding to a period of one year. The
white line in all plot is the result of averaging in 50
logarithmically spaced bins in frequency. In the middle plot for
pressure, the red line shows the corresponding averaged spectrum
constructed from the altimeter setting, with appropriate change of
units.</p>
<p><!--tex4ht:label?: x1-40093 --><!--l. 394--><!--l. 399-->The
autocovariance function (the autocorrelation multiplied by the total
variance) is related to the variance spectrum; they are Fourier
transforms of each other. The variance spectra are shown in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#x1-40093">3</a><!--tex4ht:ref: fig:varspec -->.
The variance spectrum for white noise, shown in the top plot, is a
constant function of frequency, but there is considerable variability
in the estimated spectral variance because of uncertainty in the
individual estimates. The white dashed line in that plot shows the
result of averaging in bins to reduce that uncertainty, and where the
uncertainty is small (for frequencies above about 0.1 day<sup>-1</sup>)
the spectral variance has a value of about 0.083. The standard
deviation of the values producing this spectrum is 1, so the expected
value of the spectral variance is 1/12=0.08333. This relationship can
sometimes be used to estimate the random error in a measurement,
because a random error of σ will produce a constant contribution to
the spectral variance of σ<sup>2</sup>∕12. In cases where the
high-frequency portion of the spectral variance assumes a constant
value, the random error can thus be determined from the spectral
variance there.<!--l. 417-->

<p><a name="x1-4010f3"></a><a name="x1-4011f4"></a>The middle plot
shows the variance spectrum for hourly measurements of sea-level
pressure and, as the red dashed line, the altimeter setting. There
are prominent spikes in the unaveraged spectrum with frequencies
corresponding to (1/24)&nbsp;h<sup>-1</sup> and multiples of this
frequency extending to at least ten times this frequency. These arise
from the atmospheric tides of the diurnal cycle, which instead of a
simple sine wave must instead be represented by many “harmonics”
of the basic frequency.<a href="SpecAnalysis4.html#fn3x0">3</a> The
annual cycle also makes a prominent contribution to the spectral
variance. Unlike the sea-level pressure, the altimeter setting is not
adjusted by averaging the temperature from the previous 12 h to use
for extrapolation to sea level. The higher variance in the sea-level
pressure suggests that the altimeter setting is a better variable to
use for spectral analysis, even though it is recorded with lower
resolution (0.01&nbsp;inHg or 0.3&nbsp;hPa vs 0.1&nbsp;hPa for the
sea-level pressure).<a href="SpecAnalysis5.html#fn4x0">4</a> In the
case of the measurements of temperature, the diurnal cycle is very
prominent (before averaging) and the contribution from the annual
cycle is concentrated more on the period of 365.25 days.
