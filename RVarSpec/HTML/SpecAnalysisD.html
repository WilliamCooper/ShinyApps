<h1>Instructions:</h1>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p>Select the variable to plot. These are hourly observations
	at the DIA station for about 9.5 years. SLVP=sea-level pressure
	[hPa], ALTP=altimeter setting [inHg], TMCD=temperature [deg C],
	WD=wind direction [degrees], WS=wind speed [m/s], WE=wind from
	east[m/s]; WN=wind from north [m/s].</p>
	<li/>
<p>Choose checkboxes for the types of variance spectra to
	show:</p>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p>&quot;spectrum&quot; is generated by the R routine
	&quot;spectrum&quot; with smoothing as specified by &quot;span&quot;.
		</p>
	<li/>
<p>&quot;welchPSD&quot; uses the Welch segmenting approach to
	average segments, with segment size (in days) specified by &quot;seg
	l&quot;. The actual segment length is 24 times this value because
	the time-series contains hourly values.</p>
	<li/>
<p>&quot;MEM&quot; will show the variance spectrum calculated
	using the maximum-entropy approach, with &quot;poles&quot;
	determining the number of poles (degrees of freedom used for the
	fit) and &quot;MEM resolution&quot; specifying the base-10 logarithm
	used as the increment between successive calculations of the
	spectrum.</p>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
	<li/>
<p>The standard range in frequency is 1.e-3 to 12 (the Nyquist
	frequency). It can be adjusted if necessary (e.g., to focus on a
	limited frequency range).</p>
	<li/>
<p>Set &quot;smooth bins&quot; to a number larger than 10 to
	show the spectrum smoothed into equal-size bins in the logarithm of
	frequency, spanning the frequency range. There are many points in
	this time series (83,304), so large numbers (100--500) can be used
	for the number of smoothing bins.</p>
	<li/>
<p>Use the &quot;Gaussian noise&quot; entry for exploration of
	the effect of random error. See the next tab.</p>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Suggested choices are: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">For span, 3--99 (numbers must be
	odd; if even numbers are entered, they are changed to the next odd
	number). The smoothing will continue to work for larger spans, but
	will become slow.</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">For segment length (seg l),
	powers of 2; 512 is intermediate, 64 can be a reasonable low limit,
	values above 2048 cannot be entered because there are fewer than
	4096 days in the time series.</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">For poles, 50--500; for large
	numbers of poles, the calculation becomes slow, so it's best not to
	exceed a few hundred. A small number of poles produces a smooth
	spectrum but will not detect fine structure.</p>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The small error bars at the
	right side of the plots, with color matching the spectrum to which
	they refer, are the estimated standard uncertainty in the spectrum.
	The estimate does not account for the reduction in uncertainty from
	smoothing in bins. That is shown differently, as discussed in the
	next bullet. For the MEM (red) spectrum, the uncertainty is usually
	too small to plot except for cases with very large choices for the
	&quot;MEM resolution&quot; increment. An additional red horizontal
	error bar shows the increment used in frequency. This is also often
	too small to be discerned on the plot.</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">When bin-smoothing is selected
	(via a non-zero entry in the &quot;smooth bins&quot; entry window),
	a semi-transparent colored ribbon will show the standard error of
	the averaged values. This does not consider the uncertainty of
	individual points as shown by the colored error bars, but the
	uncertainty ribbon should reflect that error bar reduced by the
	square root of the values averaged together unless there is real
	structure within the bin.</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The diurnal cycle appears in
	many of these variables as sharp spikes at periods of 1 day, 1/2
	day, 1/3 day, etc., reflecting the harmonics of the diurnal cycle.
	These may be resolved poorly unless a sufficiently low value for
	&quot;MEM resolution&quot; and a sufficiently large number of poles
	are used for the MEM calculation; these need to be about -3 (0.001
	in frequency) and about 200, respectively, to resolve the diurnal
	cycle well.</p>
