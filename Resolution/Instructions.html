<p style="font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: none">Use
the checkboxes to select the desired level of confidence at which you
would like to conclude, on the basis of measurements of each
measurand, that the measurands are indeed different. The slider below
then sets the assumed difference between two measurands. Adjust this
value until P2 matches the selected confidence level. This setting of
the slider specifies the resolution of the instrument, the separation
between measurands at which you can use measurements of the two
measurands to conclude with the specified confidence that the
measurands are different.</span></p>
