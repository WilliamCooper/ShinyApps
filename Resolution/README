The "Resolution" Shiny app illustrates the connection between instrument precision and resolution. The standard version includes text with equations and an interactive exercise, while the "SEGUE" branch has much of this material omitted because it duplicates material in the main module for Instrument Performance Characteristics. There is also an interactive demonstration of the effect of digitizing on precision.
