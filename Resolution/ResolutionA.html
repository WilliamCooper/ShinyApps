<h3 class="western"><a name="x1-1000"></a>Exercise Objective</h3>
<p><!--l. 127-->The term “resolution” is used in various ways,
some conflicting. This exercise seeks to clarify why characterizing
the resolution is difficult, and it will explain some of the varying
usages of this term. An interactive display is used to clarify some
of the concepts and avoid the need for numerical evaluation of
probabilities on the part of the reader. <!--l. 135--> 
</p>
<p>&quot;Resolution&quot; has the following meanings, depending on
the context:</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p><a name="magicparlabel-442317"></a>The smallest difference
	between measurands that will lead to corresponding measurements
	indicating that the measurands are different. The desired indication
	will have an associated confidence level, often 68.3% or that
	corresponding to one standard deviation. A primary factor
	influencing this aspect of resolution is the precision of the
	instrument. This is discussed extensively in the second tab. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p><a name="x1-2004x2"></a>The smallest change in the
	indicator (e.g., meter or digital display) that can be perceived.
	For example, the instrument resolution may be limited by the ability
	of an operator to read an analog display, by hysteresis in that
	display, or by the smallest incremental change reported on a digital
	display. In the case of a digitized result, the resolution is
	limited by the change corresponding to one unit in the digitized
	output. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p><a name="x1-2006x3"></a>For a spectrometer, the smallest
	difference in frequency that can be resolved. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p><a name="x1-2008x4"></a>For a time series, the temporal
	resolution is the increment between consecutive measurements,
	although if a particular sensor responds more slowly than this the
	temporal resolution of that sensor may be lower.</p>
</ol>
<p><!--l. 159-->The first is discussed in more detail in the next two
tabs, and the fourth tab discusses the second meaning. The third and
fourth items are not covered in this exercise.<!--l. 162-->
