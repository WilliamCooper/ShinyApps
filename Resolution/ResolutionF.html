<h4 class="western"><a name="x1-5000"></a>Summary</h4>
<p>The recommended definition of resolution is, “the smallest
difference between measurands that will result in measurements
indicating that the measurands are different.&quot; With this
definition, if a level of confidence corresponding to one standard
deviation (about 68.3%) is desired, the resolution of an instrument
or sensor is about twice the precision with which the instrument
makes measurements. Use the “Probability Distributions, Meaning #1”
tab with the first slider set to 2 and the second selection to
&quot;68.3%&quot; to see this case. If the measurement is encoded by
an analog-to-digital converter, the resolution is further limited by
the difference in measurand corresponding to a one-bit change in the
digitized output, as illustrated <a href="#x1-40017">i</a>n the
“Illustration of Meaning #2” tab. This is often described as the
resolution of the measurement, but this usage is incorrect unless the
resolution of the digitizer is the dominant limitation on the
resolution.<!--l. 420-->
