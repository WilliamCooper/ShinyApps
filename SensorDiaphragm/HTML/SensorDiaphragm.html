<p><font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif">Try changing the pressure
and see how the diaphragm deflects. Or enable the &quot;pressure&quot;
animation radio button. In a pressure sensor, this mechanical motion
is translated to an output, perhaps by deflection of a pointer on a
dial or by detection of the stress produced on an electronic sensor. </font>

<p><font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif">The reading is very
sensitive to temperature. Try moving the temperature slider and see
how sensitive the instrument is to changes in temperature. The gas is
the reference chamber obeys the ideal gas law, so with a sealed
volume the pressure is proportional to temperature. The error arising
from a temperature different from the reference temperature is
displayed below the temperature slider. Sensitivity to temperature is
a common source of error in pressure sensors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif">The reading is also
sensitive to the direction of the wind relative to the surface of the
sensor, because downward motion of the wind increases the pressure at
the entrance to the inlet tube. Explore this by varying the angle of
attack and the airspeed.</font></p>
