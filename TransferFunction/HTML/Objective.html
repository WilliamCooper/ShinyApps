interactive tool and exercise demonstrates how first-order and
second-order systems respond to various input waveforms. In the
&quot;Response Curves&quot; tab, you can select different input
waveforms including a step function, ramp function, and sine wave
with selectable frequency. </font></font>

plots show the assumed input as a red line. The calculated response
uses, for first-order response, a simple exponential with time
constant τ = 1. This response in each case is displayed as the blue
line described as “M1” in the legends. If the &quot;1st-order
damping&quot; checkbox is selected, damping is applied having
magnitude controlled by the &quot;log gamma&quot; slider, which can
vary the damping from none to enough to eliminate any response at the
two limits of the slider. (This is equivalent to changing the time
constant of a first-order system.) For second-order response for the
system displayed, which is a damped harmonic oscillator, the
resulting lines are labeled “M2” and plotted as green lines. This
second-order sensor is characterized by two parameters, taken to be
omega (ω) and gamma γ, and they can be controlled by two sliders in
the sidebar panel. The natural undamped oscillation angular frequency
is specified by ω and the ratio of the amount of damping to the
critical amount is specified by γ, so that γ = 1 specifies critical
damping and smaller values can oscillate and overshoot while larger
values respond slowly. The slider controlling the frequency applies
only to repetitive waveforms like the sine or square waves. All these
sliders are set using base-10 logarithms to provide a better range
than is possible with a linear slider, and the values actually used
are then </span></span></span></font></span><span style="font-variant: normal"><font color="#333333"><span style="letter-spacing: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">printed
