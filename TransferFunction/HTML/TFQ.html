<p><b>Transfer-function exercises:</b></p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p style="font-weight: normal">A temperature sensor on an
	aircraft has first-order dynamic response, and you need to make
	measurements that respond to abrupt (i.e., step-function) changes by
	reaching 90% of the final value in 100 m of flight path, while
	flying 200 m/s. What is the required time constant of the sensor?</p>
	<li/>
<p style="font-weight: normal">For a ramp input with slope
	such that x=t / <font face="Liberation Serif, serif">τ, at long
	times a first-order system will lag behind that input by τ (in
	these plots, 1 s), so this is a possible way to find the time
	constant and to provide corrections for such a system. For a
	second-order system, the response is more complicated and depends on
	both the characteristic angular frequency and the damping. However,
	for critical damping the system (at long time) again lags behind the
	input signal by a fixed amount, so the lag again can be used to find
	the characteristic angular frequency ω</font> <font face="Liberation Serif, serif">of
	this system. What value of ω is needed so that the second-order lag
	is also 1</font> <font face="Liberation Serif, serif">s?</font></p>
	<li/>
<p style="font-weight: normal"><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">To
	determine the type of response characteristic of an unknown system,
	it is often revealing to determine the system response to an impulse
	function. Suppose you have a measuring system with unknown
	characteristics, and you find it responds to an impulse as shown
	below:</font></p>

<p style="font-weight: normal">A1: You reach 90% response in 2.3 time
constants, as shown by the first-order response to a step function.
(To see this, select &quot;step&quot; and use the cursor moving over
the blue line to find the &quot;Time&quot; corresponding to M1=0.9.)
You need 2.3 <font face="Liberation Serif, serif">τ</font> <font face="Liberation Serif, serif">=
0.5 s or τ</font> <font face="Liberation Serif, serif">= 0.22 s.</font></p>
<p style="font-weight: normal"><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">A2:
Leave the setting of γ</font> <font face="Liberation Serif, serif">=
1 and adjust the value of ω until the first-order and second-order
response lines overlap at long time. The required value of ω is
about 2.1. [Hint: you can make fine adjustments to the sliders by
left-mouse-clicking the slider button and then using the left-arrow
or right-arrow keys.]</font> <font face="Liberation Serif, serif">Also
try some smaller values of γ</font> <font face="Liberation Serif, serif">to
see how this decreases the lag.</font></p>
<p style="font-weight: normal"><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">A3:
It is second order. A first-order system always responds toward the
current value of the input, so it would not continue upward after the
impulse function returns to zero. The slight overshoot past zero
indicates that the system is modestly underdamped, and the magnitude
of the response at about 0.2 s indicates an angular frequency
significantly larger than 1 radian/s. You can obtain a reasonable
reproduction of this response curve by moving the γ slider to give a
small overshoot and then moving the ω slider to match the amplitude
of the response. Try interatively adjusting these two controls until
the response matches the figure in the question.</font></p>
