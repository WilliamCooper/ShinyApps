<p><!--l. 143-->The plots show the assumed input as a red line. The
calculated response uses, for first-order response, a simple
exponential with time constant τ = 1. This response in each case is
displayed as the blue line described as “M1” in the legends. If
the &quot;1st-order damping&quot; checkbox is selected, damping is
applied having magnitude controlled by the &quot;log gamma&quot;
slider, which can vary the damping from none to enough to eliminate
any response at the two limits of the slider. (This is equivalent to
changing the time constant of a first-order system.) For second-order
response for the system displayed, which is a damped harmonic
oscillator, the resulting lines are labeled “M2” and plotted as
green lines. This second-order sensor is characterized by two
parameters, taken to be omega (ω) and gamma γ, and they can be
controlled by two sliders in the sidebar panel. The natural undamped
oscillation angular frequency is specified by ω and the ratio of the
amount of damping to the critical amount is specified by γ, so that
γ = 1 specifies critical damping and smaller values can oscillate
and overshoot while larger values respond slowly. The slider
controlling the frequency applies only to repetitive waveforms like
the sine or square waves. All these sliders are set using base-10
logarithms to provide a better range than is possible with a linear
slider, and the values actually used are then included in the titles
of the plots.
