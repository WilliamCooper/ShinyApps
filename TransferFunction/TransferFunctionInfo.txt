  Using the “TransferFunction” Shiny App

The plots show the assumed input as a red line. The
calculated response uses, for first-order response, a
simple exponential with time constant tau=1. This response
in each case is displayed as the blue line described as
“M1” in the legends. For second-order response for the
system displayed, which is a damped harmonic oscillator,
the resulting lines are labeled “M2” and plotted as
green lines. This second-order sensor is characterized
by two parameters, taken to be omega and gamma, and they
can be controlled by two sliders in the sidebar panel.
The natural undamped oscillation angular frequency is
specified by omega and the ratio of the amount of damping
to the critical amount is specified by gamma, so that
gamma=1 specifies critical damping and smaller values
can oscillate and overshoot while larger values respond
slowly. The slider controlling the frequency applies only
to repetitive waveforms like the sine or square waves. All
these sliders are set using base-10 logarithms to provide
a better range than is possible with a linear slider, and
the values actually used are then included in the titles
of the plots.

The R code used to generate the response is a very
simple Euler integration.  The results have been checked
against analytical solutions in some cases and match those
solutions well, but the intent of these displays is to
illustrate general features of the response to various
input signals. These results are not reliable enough for
quantitative use. The numerical integrations could easily
be improved using, e.g., Runge-Kutta methods.
