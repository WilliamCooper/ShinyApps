<h1>Using the Calculator</h1>
<p>These calculations are based on the Murphy-Koop formulas for
equilibrium vapor pressure, provided in <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1256/qj.04.94/pdf">this
publication</a>. Details as implemented in calculations for the
NSF/NCAR research aircraft are available at .<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1kIUH45ca5Aa29JbjJkel82NFU#nameddest=DPXC">this
URL</a>, page 38.</p>
<p>Enter the dew-point temperature (in units of <sup>o</sup>C) and
the atmospheric pressure (in units of hPa), and the calculator will
display the equilibrium vapor pressure, mixing ratio, and specific
humidity below the entry slots. Enter the vapor pressure (in units of
hPa) and the calculator will display the equilibrium dew-point
temperature below the entry. When a new temperature or pressure is
entered in the top entry slots, this vapor pressure will be updated
to match the resulting vapor pressure. The calculator also displays
the molecular weight and gas constant of moist air (labeled Ma and
Ra) and the mole fractions for the specified water-vapor pressure. 
</p>
<p>You can also mouse-click on the plot at the right to set the
temperature.</p>
<p>If the &quot;enhancement factor&quot; checkbox is not checked, the
vapor pressure displayed is that in equilibrium at the supplied
dew-point temperature. If it is checked, it is assumed that the
dew-point supplied is a measurement from a chilled-mirror or similar
instrument operating at the specified atmospheric pressure, for which
the equilibrium vapor pressure is raised by a small amount by the
enhancement factor described in the above publication. The &quot;corrected
dew-point temperature&quot; is then the temperature at which
equilibrium would be present without the presence of the dry part of
the atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p>The mixing ratio is calculated using the standard formula, and the
specific humidity is then calculated using the relationship q=r/(1+r)
where r is the mixing ratio.</p>
