<h3 class="western"><a name="x1-20002"></a>2 Interpreting the
Variance Spectrum</h3>
<p><!--l. 277-->The spectral variance can be regarded as a continuous
function, but in practice there are limitations to its determination.
This section discusses some of those limitations, notably the Nyquist
frequency, and then presents some examples with interpretation.<!--l. 282-->
</p>
<h4 class="western"><a name="x1-30002.1"></a>2.1 Limitations when
determining the variance spectrum</h4>
<p><!--l. 284-->Some important characteristics of the variance
spectrum are the following: 
</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-3002x1"></a>The
	Nyquist frequency: For a time series sampled at increments Δt in
	time and spanning a duration T in time, the first limitation is that
	the frequency components entering the variance spectrum cannot be
	determined for frequencies higher than 1∕(2Δt), called the
	Nyquist frequency, because at least two observations separated by Δt
	are needed to resolve this highest frequency. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-3004x2"></a>Aliasing:
	If higher frequencies are present they can contaminate the estimated
	spectral density at lower frequencies through a process called
	aliasing. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-3006x3"></a><a name="x1-3007f2"></a>
	The low-frequency limit: It becomes difficult to resolve frequencies
	smaller than 1/T . The common way of estimating the variance
	spectrum uses Fourier transforms and, because that inherently
	assumes that the function is periodic, this requires no components
	with frequency lower than 1∕T .<a href="SpecAnalysis3.html#fn2x0">2</a>
		</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-3009x4"></a>Trend
	removal. Another problem that arises from the assumption that the
	variable is periodic outside the period (0, T ) is that, if there is
	a linear increase in the variable with time, this becomes resolved
	as a triangular wave with components that contaminate the spectral
	density. For this reason, any trend in the data is normally removed
	before the variance spectrum is estimated. The mean can also be
	removed, and this is sometimes useful when numerical precision is a
	problem with the calculation. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p><a name="x1-3011x5"></a>Normalization: As used in this
	note, the variance spectrum is normalized so that the integral over
	positive frequencies gives the variance. Sometimes the normalization
	is such that the integral over both negative and positive
	frequencies gives the variance, so determining the normalization
	used is important when examining a plotted variance spectrum.</p>

<p><!--l. 332-->Again for simplicity first focus on a time series.
The following plot (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#x1-40011">1</a><!--tex4ht:ref: fig:random-time-series -->
shows three time series that have very different character: 
</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-4003x1"></a>The top
	series shows a series of values generated from random numbers
	generated from a normal distribution having mean zero and unit
	standard deviation. Knowing the preceding value of the variable does
	not provide any information on the next measurement; sequential
	measurements are completely uncorrelated. A similar series generated
	using uniformly distributed random numbers between -1 and 1 looks
	different because all values remain in the range from -1 to 1, but
	the randomness of the values still provides no serial correlations
	in the time series. Both ways of generating a time series produce
	“white noise”, a term used to describe a signal where the
	spectral density is a constant function of frequency and successive
	values in the time series are uncorrelated. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-4005x2"></a>The
	middle time series shows one week of sea-level pressure
	measurements. There is strong correlation among the measurements,
	such that knowledge of preceding measurements can be used to predict
	the next measurement with less than the sample variance. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p><a name="x1-4007x3"></a>The bottom time series, temperature
	measurements, shows evidence of a daily cycle in addition to
	important serial correlations. The spectral variance should
	highlight this daily cycle. (It will be present in the pressure
	measurements also, although with less prominence.)</p>

<p>Figure&nbsp;2: Autocorrelation functions for the 9.5-y time series
of variables like those in the preceding figure.</p>
<p style="border-top: none; border-bottom: 1.10pt double #808080; border-left: none; border-right: none; padding: 0in">
<!--tex4ht:label?: x1-40082 --><!--l. 365--></p>
<p><!--l. 370-->The autocorrelation functions for these series have
distinctly different characteristics. The preceding figure was
generated from one week of data, for the next plots about 9.5 years
of similar observations will be used. The resulting autocorrelation
functions are shown in Fig.<a href="#x1-40082">2</a><!--tex4ht:ref: fig:acf -->.
For the white-noise sample, only the lag-zero value is different from
zero, which reflects that there is no correlation between consecutive
random numbers at any lag. The bottom plot for temperature, however,
shows a dominating diurnal cycle. If plotted for longer time
differences, it also shows a prominent annual cycle. The middle plot
for sea-level pressure and the bottom plot for temperature show a
significant correlation over a period of a few days, reflecting the
important influence of passing large-scale weather systems. The
variance spectrum for pressure also displays an annual and a diurnal
cycle, but the diurnal cycle is barely perceptible in this plot. It
will be revealed in the variance spectrum.<!--l. 387-->

<p>Figure&nbsp;3: Variance spectra corresponding to the three cases
presented in the preceding two figures. The dotted-black vertical
lines mark the frequency corresponding to a period of one year. The
white line in all plot is the result of averaging in 50
logarithmically spaced bins in frequency. In the middle plot for
pressure, the red line shows the corresponding averaged spectrum
constructed from the altimeter setting, with appropriate change of
units.</p>
<p style="border-top: none; border-bottom: 1.10pt double #808080; border-left: none; border-right: none; padding: 0in">
<!--tex4ht:label?: x1-40093 --><!--l. 394--></p>
<p><!--l. 399-->The autocovariance function (the autocorrelation
multiplied by the total variance) is related to the variance
spectrum; they are Fourier transforms of each other. The variance
spectra are shown in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#x1-40093">3</a><!--tex4ht:ref: fig:varspec -->.
The variance spectrum for white noise, shown in the top plot, is a
constant function of frequency, but there is considerable variability
in the estimated spectral variance because of uncertainty in the
individual estimates. The white dashed line in that plot shows the
result of averaging in bins to reduce that uncertainty, and where the
uncertainty is small (for frequencies above about 0.1 day<sup>-1</sup>)
the spectral variance has a value of about 0.083. The standard
deviation of the values producing this spectrum is 1, so the expected
value of the spectral variance is 1/12=0.08333. This relationship can
sometimes be used to estimate the random error in a measurement,
because a random error of σ will produce a constant contribution to
the spectral variance of σ<sup>2</sup>∕12. In cases where the
high-frequency portion of the spectral variance assumes a constant
value, the random error can thus be determined from the spectral
variance there.<!--l. 417--> 
</p>
<p><a name="x1-4010f3"></a><a name="x1-4011f4"></a>The middle plot
shows the variance spectrum for hourly measurements of sea-level
pressure and, as the red dashed line, the altimeter setting. There
are prominent spikes in the unaveraged spectrum with frequencies
corresponding to (1/24)&nbsp;h<sup>-1</sup> and multiples of this
frequency extending to at least ten times this frequency. These arise
from the atmospheric tides of the diurnal cycle, which instead of a
simple sine wave must instead be represented by many “harmonics”
of the basic frequency.<a href="SpecAnalysis4.html#fn3x0">3</a> The
annual cycle also makes a prominent contribution to the spectral
variance. Unlike the sea-level pressure, the altimeter setting is not
adjusted by averaging the temperature from the previous 12 h to use
for extrapolation to sea level. The higher variance in the sea-level
pressure suggests that the altimeter setting is a better variable to
use for spectral analysis, even though it is recorded with lower
resolution (0.01&nbsp;inHg or 0.3&nbsp;hPa vs 0.1&nbsp;hPa for the
sea-level pressure).<a href="SpecAnalysis5.html#fn4x0">4</a> In the
case of the measurements of temperature, the diurnal cycle is very
prominent (before averaging) and the contribution from the annual
cycle is concentrated more on the period of 365.25 days.
