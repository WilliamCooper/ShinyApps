<p>Some important characteristics of the variance spectrum are the
following: 
</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-3002x1"></a>The
	Nyquist frequency: For a time series sampled at increments Δt in
	time and spanning a duration T in time, the first limitation is that
	the frequency components entering the variance spectrum cannot be
	determined for frequencies higher than 1∕(2Δt), called the
	Nyquist frequency, because at least two observations separated by Δt
	are needed to resolve this highest frequency. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-3004x2"></a>Aliasing:
	If higher frequencies are present they can contaminate the estimated
	spectral density at lower frequencies through a process called
	aliasing. The figure at the bottom of this page illustrates how
	aliasing arises.</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-3006x3"></a><a name="x1-3007f2"></a>
	The low-frequency limit: It becomes difficult to resolve frequencies
	smaller than 1/T . The common way of estimating the variance
	spectrum uses Fourier transforms and, because that inherently
	assumes that the function is periodic, this requires no components
	with frequency lower than 1∕T .<a href="SpecAnalysis3.html#fn2x0">2</a>
		</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-3009x4"></a>Trend
	removal. Another problem that arises from the assumption that the
	variable is periodic outside the period (0, T ) is that, if there is
	a linear increase in the variable with time, this becomes resolved
	as a triangular wave with components that contaminate the spectral
	density. For this reason, any trend in the data is normally removed
	before the variance spectrum is estimated. The mean can also be
	removed, and this is sometimes useful when numerical precision is a
	problem with the calculation. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p><a name="x1-3011x5"></a>Normalization: As used in this
	note, the variance spectrum is normalized so that the integral over
	positive frequencies gives the variance. Sometimes the normalization
	is such that the integral over both negative and positive
	frequencies gives the variance, so determining the normalization
	used is important when examining a plotted variance spectrum.</p>

<h4 class="western">Figure caption: <span style="font-weight: normal">This
figure shows a 15-Hz signal (blue line) that is sampled at 16 Hz, at
the points indicated by black dots. 16 Hz is well above the Nyquist
frequency of 7.5 Hz, so any attempt to measure frequencies higher
than the Nyquist frequency will result in the measurement of an
incorrect frequency. In this case, the 15-Hz signal will be aliased
to (i.e., measured at) 1 Hz.</span></h4>
