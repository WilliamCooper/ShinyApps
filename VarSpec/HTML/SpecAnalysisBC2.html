<p>Figure&nbsp;1: Three time series of hourly values spanning one
week. (top) A sequence of values generated using a Gaussian
random-number generator producing deviations about a mean of 0 with a
standard deviation of 1; (middle) Surface pressure measurements from
Denver CO for one week; (bottom) Temperature measurements from Denver
CO for one week.</p>
<p><!--tex4ht:label?: x1-40011 --><!--l. 327--><!--l. 332-->Again for
simplicity first focus on a time series. The plot shown above (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#x1-40011">1)</a><!--tex4ht:ref: fig:random-time-series -->
shows three time series that have very different character: 
</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-4003x1"></a>The top
	series shows a series of values generated from random numbers
	generated from a normal distribution having mean zero and unit
	standard deviation. Knowing the preceding value of the variable does
	not provide any information on the next measurement; sequential
	measurements are completely uncorrelated. A similar series generated
	using uniformly distributed random numbers between -1 and 1 looks
	different because all values remain in the range from -1 to 1, but
	the randomness of the values still provides no serial correlations
	in the time series. Both ways of generating a time series produce
	“white noise”, a term used to describe a signal where the
	spectral density is a constant function of frequency and successive
	values in the time series are uncorrelated. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-4005x2"></a>The
	middle time series shows one week of sea-level pressure
	measurements. There is strong correlation among the measurements,
	such that knowledge of preceding measurements can be used to predict
	the next measurement with less than the sample variance. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p><a name="x1-4007x3"></a>The bottom time series, temperature
	measurements, shows evidence of a daily cycle in addition to
	important serial correlations. The spectral variance should
	highlight this daily cycle. (It will be present in the pressure
	measurements also, although with less prominence.)</p>
