<p>Figure&nbsp;2: Autocorrelation functions for the 9.5-y time series
of variables like those in the preceding figure.</p>
<p><!--tex4ht:label?: x1-40082 --><!--l. 365--><!--l. 370-->The
autocorrelation functions for these series have distinctly different
characteristics. The preceding figure was generated from one week of
data, for the next plots about 9.5 years of similar observations will
be used. The resulting autocorrelation functions are shown in Fig.<a href="#x1-40082">2</a><!--tex4ht:ref: fig:acf -->.
For the white-noise sample, only the lag-zero value is different from
zero, which reflects that there is no correlation between consecutive
random numbers at any lag. The bottom plot for temperature, however,
shows a dominating diurnal cycle. If plotted for longer time
differences, it also shows a prominent annual cycle. The middle plot
for sea-level pressure and the bottom plot for temperature show a
significant correlation over a period of a few days, reflecting the
important influence of passing large-scale weather systems. The
variance spectrum for pressure also displays an annual and a diurnal
cycle, but the diurnal cycle is barely perceptible in this plot. It
will be revealed in the variance spectrum.<!--l. 387-->
