<p class="noindent"><!--l. 448-->Because white noise has constant
spectral variance, it is often possible to estimate instrument
precision (random error) from measured time series. There are three
common approaches: 
</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-5002x1"></a>Identifying
	regions is the variance spectrum, usually near the highest
	frequency, where the spectral variance is constant. If the spectral
	variance <i><b>P(ν) </b></i>in such a region is constant at the
	level <i><b>P</b></i><sub><i><b>min</b></i></sub>, the corresponding
	random error (if Gaussian) is <i><b>σ =</b></i> 
	<img src="SpecAnalysis6e.png" name="Image6" alt="√ -------  12Pmin" align="bottom" width="50" height="25" border="0"/>
<i><b>.
	</b></i>Even when the spectral variance is not constant, the minimum
	value can be used with the preceding formula to estimate an upper
	limit to the precision.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="PSFCpsd.png" name="Image7" alt="PIC" align="bottom" width="500" height="250" border="0"/>
<br/>
The
	blue line in the plot above is the spectral variance for a 26-min
	sample of 25 Hz pressure measurements from a stationary research
	aircraft on the ground awaiting takeoff. The pressure fluctuations
	mostly reflect random error in the measurement, and because they
	produce a spectrum with the approximate value of <i><b>2 ×
	10</b></i><sup><i><b>-4</b></i></sup><i><b>hPa</b></i><sup><i><b>2</b></i></sup><i><b>Hz</b></i><sup><i><b>-1</b></i></sup>,
	the indicated standard uncertainty is about 0.05&nbsp;hPa. As a
	check, the red line shows the spectrum (with strong smoothing) that
	results from a similar time sequence generated by a Gaussian
	random-number generator with standard deviation 0.05&nbsp;hPa. This
	is then an estimate of the precision of the pressure sensor used to
	make these measurements. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-5004x2"></a>White
	noise has zero autocorrelation at any non-zero lag, so the plotted
	autocorrelation can often be used to estimate the random error. If
	the zero-lag autocorrelation does not correspond to reasonable
	extrapolation from the first few lags, the excess at lag zero
	multiplied by the variance in the signal can be attributed to random
	error. A reasonable estimate of the precision is 
	<i><b>σ =</b></i><img src="SpecAnalysis7e.png" name="Image8" alt="√ ---  Ve" align="bottom" width="50" height="25" border="0"/>

	where <i><b>V</b></i><sub><i><b>e</b></i></sub> is the excess
	variance at lag zero. An example for the same time series used for
	the preceding variance spectrum is shown below:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="acfWECANpsfdc.png" name="Image9" alt="PIC" align="bottom" width="500" height="250" border="0"/>
<br/>
<br/>
The
	autocorrelation function drops to about 0.25 after lag-0, so about
	75% of the variance at lag-0 can be attributed to random error in
	the measurement. The estimated random error in the measurement is
	then 
	<img src="SpecAnalysis8e.png" name="Image10" alt="√ ------  0.75V" align="bottom" width="50" height="25" border="0"/>
	where <i><b>V </b></i>is the variance, so in this case the estimated
	precision of the sensor is 0.06&nbsp;hPa, in reasonable agreement
	with the value obtained from the variance spectrum. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p><a name="x1-5006x3"></a><a name="x1-5007f5"></a>A plot
	called “Allan variance” can be used to isolate the contribution
	from random error and also to determine over what measurement
	separation random error dominates the signal.<a href="../SpecAnalysis.html.LyXconv/SpecAnalysis6.html#fn5x0">5</a>
	The details are beyond the scope of this note, but the general idea
	is as follows. Imagine that the output from a sensor is a
	combination of random error (noise), signal, and systematic error
	that might vary during a particular sampling period. Random error
	can be reduced by averaging repeated measurements, while the other
	components are not reduced by averaging. Consider a time-series of
	measurements, consisting in the example below of a 26-min sequence
	of 25 Hz measurements of pressure from a research aircraft on the
	ground awaiting takeoff. Real fluctuations in pressure are small in
	this situation, so it is possible to analyze the signal to find the
	noise contribution and relate that to the precision of the
	sensor.<br/>
<br/>
In the plot below, the standard deviation in
	clusters of data assembled from the time series is shown as a
	function of the time interval spanned by each cluster. The minimum
	cluster time for a 25 Hz signal is 0.04 s, and at this point the
	Allan variance reaches a value of about 4<i><b>×10</b></i><sup><i><b>-3</b></i></sup>
	Pa<sup><i><b>2</b></i></sup>. As the cluster size increases, the
	Allan variance decreases linearly on this logarithmic plot, and this
	indicates the region in the plot where random error dominates the
	fluctuations in the signal and where averaging over time intervals
	up to about 5 s continues to reduce the Allan variance. The minimum
	value of of variance, about 2<i><b>×10</b></i><sup><i><b>-5</b></i></sup>
	, occurs at 5 s, and beyond that time averaging increases the
	variance so the signals with these periods are not dominated by
	random error. <br/>

<br/>
From
	this plot, we can conclude that, for this pressure sensor used under
	these conditions: (i) the random error, or instrument precision, 
	is<img src="SpecAnalysis9e.png" name="Image12" alt="√ ----------  3.6× 10- 3" align="bottom" width="50" height="25" border="0"/>
=0.06
	hPa; (ii) the linear decrease from this point to the minimum point
	confirms that this region is dominated by random error, and
	averaging would effectively reduce the error for periods up to about
	5 s; (iii) at a particular sample size, only signals with real
	variance larger than indicated by the decreasing part of the plot
	can be detected without being obscured by noise; and (iv) the
	minimum variance corresponds to a standard deviation of 0.004 Pa, so
	an optimum use of these measurements (5-s averaging) could reduce
	the part of the uncertainty not arising from steady systematic error
	to this level when conditions are steady. (The plot cannot
	characterize steady systematic errors like calibration errors
	because they do not fluctuate and so do not contribute to the
	variance.) <br/>
<br/>
Other points along the linear-decreasing line
	represent possible compromises between time resolution and
	uncertainty, e.g., 1-s averaging leads to an estimated contribution
	to uncertainty of about 0.01 Pa from random error. The part of the
	systematic error that varies during the sampling period with
	frequency 1/(5 s) is not larger than the variance at the minimum,
	where the standard deviation is 0.004 hPa, so this is a useful limit
	on at least the variable component of the systematic error. The
	increasing part of the plot is often dominated by real signal.</p>
