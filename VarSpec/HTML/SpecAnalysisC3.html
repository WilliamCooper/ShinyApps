<p><!--l. 533-->This reduction refers to the variance in the
estimates and should not be confused with the variance in the time
series. A property of the periodogram is that the variance in the
individual estimates is equal to the magnitude of the estimate
itself, so the result appears to be very noisy. There are many ways
to smooth the resulting spectrum and reduce this variance in the
estimates. They include: 
</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-8002x1"></a>Moving
	smoothing functions. A common choice, implemented in “spectrum()”
	as discussed below, is the Daniell smoother, which in effect applies
	a moving-average smoother. This can be introduced into the estimate
	of spectral variance by including the argument “spans=c(i1,i2,...)”
	in the call to “spectrum()”, where the arguments {i1,i2,i3} are
	odd integers determining the span of consecutive moving-average
	smoothers applied to the resulting spectrum. Large numbers give more
	smoothing at the expense of loss of frequency resolution. In the
	plots produced by “spectrum()”, an error bar plotted at the top
	right indicates the uncertainty in the estimate of the spectral
	variance. The reduction in variance is often substantial; for a
	moving average, the reduction would be expected to be inversely
	proportional to the square root of the number of estimates averaged
	together. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-8004x2"></a>Segmenting
	and averaging the resulting spectra. The time series can be
	subdivided into segments, which may be overlapping, and the
	estimates of spectral variance obtained from those individual
	segments can then be averaged to reduce the estimates in the
	variance. This bears the penalty of reducing the longest period that
	can be determined, but in a long time series it is often of greater
	interest to determine the high-frequency component. An R package is
	available to accomplish this smoothing, which is often called “Welch
	smoothing”: bspec::welchPSD(). The package “bspec” may need to
	be downloaded from the standard CRAN repository because it is not
	part of the standard R routines. The length of the (overlapping)
	segments to use can be specified in the function call. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p><a name="x1-8006x3"></a>Binning and averaging. Another
	option is simply to combine estimates in bins into a single mean
	estimate that represents that bin. This can be particularly useful
	in the case of displays with logarithmic abscissas, because bins can
	be defined in equal logarithmic intervals to span equal abscissa
	distances on a logarithmic plot.</p>

Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#x1-80075">5</a><!--tex4ht:ref: fig:smoothOptions -->.
The degree of smoothing has a strong effect on the diurnal peaks
because they are so limited in frequency, so too much smoothing
caused spectral resolution to deteriorate.<!--l. 589-->
