This is an addition to the “RSessions” tutorial that provided guidance on getting started with analyzing aircraft data using R and the “Ranadu” package of routines. This is more detailed than the other tutorials in those sessions and attempts to be reasonably thorough in its review of spectral analysis using R, although it (as of yet) does not include discussion of coherence, phase, and the cross-spectrum and co-spectrum.

The R code for the entire app is displayed, either to the right of the main display or below it. There is a button to click to toggle between these two positions. That code shows in detail how the plots, and in particular the plots generated interactively in the right tab, are being generated.
